# Hack-O-Uplift-Project

Our Project will recognize handwritten characters, i.e., English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

Handwritten Character Recogntion Project was all about it helps us to predict the character which we had take as input..
I had used CNN Algorithm in this Project which had given god Accuracy..

Here I had uploaded Jupyter Notebook File, Some External Inputs Which I had used in process.
Dataset (which was taken from kaggle) is not uploaded because it was too large dataset. So, I'm giving Link of that dataset of Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
